Project 1: Titanic_Model
========================
##### Developing a model to predict survival onboard the Titanic

⋅⋅* This is a project based on the competition from kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic 
⋅⋅* Data was provided by kaggle, description of data can be found in the link above.
⋅⋅* Data visualisation with seaborn and Data Cleaning (Imputing, OneHotEncoding, Scaling) with sklearn
⋅⋅* 4 models built and 2 optimised using GridSearchCv
⋅⋅* Best classification model found was a optimised logistic regression model (app. 81% acc on validation set)
