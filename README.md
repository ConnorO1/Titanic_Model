Project 1: Titanic_Model
========================
#### Developing a model to predict survival onboard the Titanic

+ Data was provided by kaggle, description of data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic.
+ Initial EDA inclusing Data visualisation and Data Cleaning using common python libraries (seaborn, sklearn).
+ Binary classification task: 4 models built and best performers optimised using GridSearchCv.
+ Best classification model found was an optimised logistic regression model.
+ Model and parameter search was not exhaustive. Improvements to be made.
